title: Adding Instance Properties

## Simple Example

There may be data/utilities you'd like to use in many components, but you don't want to [pollute the global scope](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch3.md). In these cases, you can make them available to each Vue instance by defining them on the prototype:

``` js
Vue.prototype.$appName = 'My App'
```

Now `$appName` is available on all Vue instances, even before creation. If we run:

``` js
new Vue({
  beforeCreate: function () {
    console.log(this.$appName)
  }
})
```

Then `"My App"` will be logged to the console!

## The Importance of Scoping Instance Properties

You may be wondering:

> "Why does `appName` start with `$`? Is that important? What does it do?

No magic is happening here. `$` is a convention Vue uses for properties that are available to all instances. This avoids conflicts with any defined data, computed properties, or methods.

> "Conflicts? What do you mean?"

Another great question! If you set:

``` js
Vue.prototype.appName = 'My App'
```

Then what would you expect to be logged below?

``` js
new Vue({
  data: {
    // Uh oh - appName is *also* the name of the
    // instance property we defined!
    appName: 'The name of some other app'
  },
  beforeCreate: function () {
    console.log(this.appName)
  },
  created: function () {
    console.log(this.appName)
  }
})
```

It would be `"The name of some other app"`, then `"My App"`, because `this.appName` is overwritten ([sort of](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch5.md)) by `data` when the instance is created. We scope instance properties with `$` to avoid this. You can even use your own convention if you'd like, such as `$_appName` or `Î©appName`, to prevent even conflicts with plugins or future features.

## Real-World Example: Replacing Vue Resource with Axios

Let's say you're replacing the [now-retired Vue Resource](https://medium.com/the-vue-point/retiring-vue-resource-871a82880af4). You really enjoyed accessing request methods through `this.$http` and you want to do the same thing with Axios instead.

All you have to do is include axios in your project:

``` html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/axios/0.15.2/axios.js"></script>

<div id="app">
  <ul>
    <li v-for="user in users">{{ user.name }}</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

Alias `axios` to `Vue.prototype.$http`:

``` js
Vue.prototype.$http = axios
```

Then you'll be able to use methods like `this.$http.get` in any Vue instance:

``` js
new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    users: []
  },
  created () {
    var vm = this
    this.$http.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
      .then(function (response) {
        vm.users = response.data
      })
  }
})
```

## The Context of Prototype Methods

In case you're not aware, methods added to a prototype in JavaScript gain the context of the instance. That means they can use `this` to access data, computed properties, methods, or anything else defined on the instance.

Let's take advantage of this in a `$reverseText` method:

``` js
Vue.prototype.$reverseText = function (propertyName) {
  this[propertyName] = this[propertyName].split('').reverse().join('')
}

new Vue({
  data: {
    message: 'Hello'
  },
  created: function () {
    console.log(this.message)    // => "Hello"
    this.$reverseText('message')
    console.log(this.message)    // => "olleH"
  }
})
```

Note that the context binding will __not__ work if you use an ES6/2015 arrow function, as they implicitly bind to their parent scope. That means the arrow function version:

``` js
Vue.prototype.$reverseText = propertyName => {
  this[propertyName] = this[propertyName].split('').reverse().join('')
}
```

Would throw an error:

``` log
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'split' of undefined
```

## When To Avoid This Pattern

As long as you're vigilant in scoping prototype properties, using this pattern is quite safe - as in, unlikely to produce bugs.

However, it can sometimes cause confusion with other developers. They might see `this.$http`, for example, and think, "Oh, I didn't know about this Vue feature!" Then they move to a different project and are confused when `this.$http` is undefined. Or, maybe they want to Google how to do something, but can't find results because they don't realize they're actually using Axios under an alias.

__The convenience comes at the cost of explicitness.__ When looking at a component, it's impossible to tell where `$http` came from. Vue itself? A plugin? A coworker?

So what are the alternatives?

## Alternative Patterns

### When Not Using a Module System

In applications with __no__ module system (e.g. via Webpack or Browserify), there's a pattern that's often used with _any_ JavaScript-enhanced frontend: a global `App` object.

If what you want to add has nothing to do with Vue specifically, this may be a good alternative to reach for. Here's an example:

``` js
var App = Object.freeze({
  name: 'My App',
  description: '2.1.4',
  helpers: {
    // This is a purely functional version of
    // the $reverseText method we saw earlier
    reverseText: function (text) {
      return text.split('').reverse().join('')
    }
  }
})
```

<p class="tip">If you raised an eyebrow at `Object.freeze`, what it does is prevent the object from being changed in the future. This essentially makes all its properties constants, protecting you from future state bugs.</p>

Now the source of these shared properties is more obvious: there's an `App` object defined somewhere in the app. To find it, developers can run a project-wide search.

Another advantage is that `App` can now be used _anywhere_ in your code, whether it's Vue-related or not. That includes attaching values directly to instance options, rather than having to enter a function to access properties on `this`:

``` js
new Vue({
  data: {
    appVersion: App.version
  },
  methods: {
    reverseText: App.helpers.reverseText
  }
})
```

### When Using a Module System

When you have access to a module system, you can easily organize shared code into modules, then `require`/`import` those modules wherever they're needed. This is the epitome of explicitness, because in each file you gain a list of dependencies. You know _exactly_ where each one came from.

While certainly more verbose, this approach is definitely the most maintainable, especially when working with other developers and/or building a large app.
