Vue's community is growing incredibly fast and if you're reading this, there's a good chance you're ready to join it. So... welcome!

Now we'll answer both what the community can do for you and what you can do for the community.

## Resources

### Code of Conduct

Our [Code of Conduct](/coc) is a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

### Get Support

- [Forum](https://forum.vuejs.org/): The best place to ask questions and get answers about Vue and its ecosystem.
- [Chat](https://chat.vuejs.org/): A place for Vue devs to meet and chat in real time.
- [Meetups](https://www.vuemeetups.org): Want to find local Vue.js enthusiasts like yourself? Interested in becoming a community leader? We have the help and support you need right here!
- [GitHub](https://github.com/vuejs): If you have a bug to report or feature to request, that's what the GitHub issues are for. We also welcome pull requests!

### Explore the Ecosystem

- [The Awesome Vue Page](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue): See what other awesome resources have been published by other awesome people.
- [The "Show and Tell" Subforum](https://forum.vuejs.org/c/show-and-tell): Another great place to check out what others have built with and for the growing Vue ecosystem.

## What You Can Do

### Contribute Code

As with any project, there are rules to contributing. To ensure that we can help you or accept your pull request as quickly as possible, please read [the contributing guide](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

After that, you'll be ready to contribute to Vue's core repositories:

- [vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue): the core library
- [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex): Flux-inspired state management
- [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router): a routing system for SPAs

...as well as many smaller official [companion libraries](https://github.com/vuejs).

### Share (and Build) Your Experience

Apart from answering questions and sharing resources in the forum and chat, there are a few other less obvious ways to share and expand what you know:

- **Develop learning materials.** It's often said that the best way to learn is to teach. If there's something interesting you're doing with Vue, strengthen your expertise by writing a blog post, developing a workshop, or even publishing a gist that you share on social media.
- **Watch a repo you care about.** This will send you notifications whenever there's activity in that repository, giving you insider knowledge about ongoing discussions and upcoming features. It's a fantastic way to build expertise so that you're eventually able to help address issues and pull requests.

### Translate Docs

Vue has already spread across the globe, with even the core team in at least half a dozen timezones. [The forum](https://forum.vuejs.org/) includes 7 languages and counting and many of our docs have [actively-maintained translations](https://github.com/vuejs?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=vuejs.org). We're very proud of Vue's international reach, but we can do even better.

I hope that right now, you're reading this sentence in your preferred language. If not, would you like to help us get there?

If so, please feel free to fork the repo for [these docs](https://github.com/vuejs/vuejs.org/) or for any other officially maintained documentation, then start translating. Once you've made some progress, open an issue or pull request in the main repo and we'll put out a call for more contributors to help you out.

### Become a Community Leader

There's a lot you can do to help Vue grow in your community:

- **Present at your local meetup.** Whether it's giving a talk or running a workshop, you can bring a lot of value to your community by helping both new and experienced Vue developers continue to grow.
- **Start your own meetup.** If there's not already a Vue meetup in your area, you can start your own! Use the [resources at vuemeetups.org](https://www.vuemeetups.org/resources/#introduction) to help you succeed!
- **Help meetup organizers.** There can never be too much help when it comes to running an event, so offer a hand to help out local organizers to help make every event a success.

If you have any questions on how you can get more involved with your local Vue community, reach out at [hello@vuemeetups.org](mailto:hello@vuemeetups.org) or [@VueMeetups](https://www.twitter.com/vuemeetups)!
