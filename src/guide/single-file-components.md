## Introduction

In many Vue projects, global components will be defined using `Vue.component`, followed by `new Vue({ el: '#container '})` to target a container element in the body of every page.

This can work very well for small to medium-sized projects, where JavaScript is only used to enhance certain views. In more complex projects however, or when your frontend is entirely driven by JavaScript, these disadvantages become apparent:

- **Global definitions** force unique names for every component
- **String templates** lack syntax highlighting and require ugly slashes for multiline HTML
- **No CSS support** means that while HTML and JavaScript are modularized into components, CSS is conspicuously left out
- **No build step** restricts us to HTML and ES5 JavaScript, rather than preprocessors like Pug (formerly Jade) and Babel

All of these are solved by **single-file components** with a `.vue` extension, made possible with build tools such as Webpack or Browserify.

Here's a simple example of a file we'll call `Hello.vue`:

<img src="/images/vue-component.png" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto">

Now we get:

- [Complete syntax highlighting](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue#syntax-highlighting)
- [CommonJS modules](https://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html)
- [Component-scoped CSS](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/blob/master/docs/en/features/scoped-css.md)

As promised, we can also use preprocessors such as Jade, Babel, and Stylus for cleaner and more feature-rich components.

These specific languages are just examples. You could just as easily use Marko, TypeScript, and SCSS - or whatever other preprocessors that help you be productive.

## Getting Started

### For Users New to Module Build Systems in JavaScript

With `.vue` components, we're entering the realm of advanced JavaScript applications. That means learning to use a few additional tools if you haven't already:

- **Node Package Manager (NPM)**: Read the [Getting Started guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) through section _10: Uninstalling global packages_.
- **Modern JavaScript with ES2015/16**: Read through Babel's [Learn ES2015 guide](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/). You don't have to memorize every feature right now, but keep this page as a reference you can come back to.

After you've taken a day to dive into these resources, we recommend checking out the [browserify-simple-2.0](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/browserify-simple-2.0) template, which is the simplest template that uses `.vue` components.

If you'd like to learn more about how `.vue` components work with Browserify, you can read [these docs](https://github.com/vuejs/vueify/blob/master/README.md). To learn more about Browserify itself, [their Usage guide](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify#usage) is recommended reading.

### For Advanced Users

Whether you prefer Webpack, Browserify, or SystemJS, we have documented templates for both simple and more complex projects. We recommend browsing [github.com/vuejs-templates](https://github.com/vuejs-templates), picking a template that's right for you, then following the instructions in the README to generate a new project with [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).

## Deploying for Production

The minified standalone build of Vue has already stripped out all the warnings for you for a smaller file size, but when you are using tools like Webpack or Browserify, you will need some additional configuration to achieve this.

### Webpack

Use Webpack's [DefinePlugin](http://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#defineplugin) to indicate a production environment, so that warning blocks can be automatically dropped by UglifyJS during minification. Example config:

``` js
var webpack = require('webpack')

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // ...
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        NODE_ENV: '"production"'
      }
    }),
    new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({
      compress: {
        warnings: false
      }
    })
  ]
}
```

### Browserify

- Run your bundling command with `NODE_ENV` set to `"production"`. This tells `vueify` to avoid including hot-reload and development related code.
- Apply a global [envify](https://github.com/hughsk/envify) transform to your bundle. This allows the minifier to strip out all the warnings in Vue's source code wrapped in env variable conditional blocks. For example:


``` bash
NODE_ENV=production browserify -g envify -e main.js | uglifyjs -c -m > build.js
```

- To extract styles to a separate css file use a extract-css plugin which is included in vueify.

``` bash
NODE_ENV=production browserify -g envify -p [ vueify/plugins/extract-css -o build.css ] -e main.js | uglifyjs -c -m > build.js
```
