title: Migration from Vue 1.x
type: guide
order: 25
---

## FAQ

> Woah - this is a super long page! Does that mean 2.0 is completely different, I'll have to learn the basics all over again, and migrating will be practically impossible?

I'm glad you asked! The answer is no. About 90% of the API is the same and the core concepts haven't changed. It's long because we like to offer very detailed explanations and include a lot of examples. Rest assured, __this is not something you have to read from top to bottom!__

> Where should I start in a migration?

1. Start by running the [migration helper](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper) on a current project. We've carefully minified and compressed a senior Vue dev into a simple command line interface. Whenever they recognize a deprecated pattern, they'll let you know, offer suggestions, and provide links to more info.

2. After that, browse through the table of contents for this page in the sidebar. If you see a topic you may be affected by, but the migration helper didn't catch, check it out.

3. If you have any tests, run them and see what still fails. If you don't have tests, just open the app in your browser and keep an eye out for warnings or errors as you navigate around.

4. By now, your app should be fully migrated. If you're still hungry for more though, you can read the rest of this page - or just dive in to the new and improved guide from [the beginning](index.html). Many parts will be skimmable, since you're already familiar with the core concepts.

> How long will it take to migrate a Vue 1.x app to 2.0?

It depends on a few factors:

- The size of your app (small to medium-sized apps will probably be less than a day)

- How many times you get distracted and start playing with a cool new feature. ðŸ˜‰ &nbsp;Not judging, it also happened to us while building 2.0!

- Which deprecated features you're using. Most can be upgraded with find-and-replace, but others might take a few minutes. If you're not currently following best practices, Vue 2.0 will also try harder to force you to. This is a good thing in the long run, but could also mean a significant (though possibly overdue) refactor.

> If I upgrade to Vue 2, will I also have to upgrade Vuex and Vue-Router?

Only Vue-Router 2 is compatible with Vue 2, so yes, you'll have to follow the [migration path for Vue-Router](migration-vue-router.html) as well. Fortunately, most applications don't have a lot of router code, so this likely won't take more than an hour.

As for Vuex, even version 0.8 is compatible with Vue 2, so you're not forced to upgrade. The only reason you may want to upgrade immediately is to take advantage of the new features in Vuex 2, such as modules and reduced boilerplate.

## Templates

### Fragment Instances <sup>deprecated</sup>

Every component must have exactly one root element. Fragment instances are no longer allowed. If you have a template like this:

``` html
<p>foo</p>
<p>bar</p>
```

It's recommended to simply wrap the entire contents in a new element, like this:

``` html
<div>
  <p>foo</p>
  <p>bar</p>
</div>
```

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run your end-to-end test suite or app after upgrading and look for <strong>console warnings</strong> about multiple root elements in a template.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

## Lifecycle Hooks

### `beforeCompile` <sup>deprecated</sup>

Use the `created` hook instead.

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find all examples of this hook.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `compiled` <sup>deprecated</sup>

Use the new `mounted` hook instead.

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find all examples of this hook.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `attached` <sup>deprecated</sup>

Use a custom in-dom check in other hooks. For example, to replace:

``` js
attached: function () {
  doSomething()
}
```

You could use:

``` js
mounted: function () {
  this.$nextTick(function () {
    doSomething()
  })
}
```

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find all examples of this hook.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `detached` <sup>deprecated</sup>

Use a custom in-dom check in other hooks. For example, to replace:

``` js
detached: function () {
  doSomething()
}
```

You could use:

``` js
destroyed: function () {
  this.$nextTick(function () {
    doSomething()
  })
}
```

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find all examples of this hook.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `init` <sup>deprecated</sup>

Use the new `beforeCreate` hook instead, which is essentially the same thing. It was renamed for consistency with other lifecycle methods.

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find all examples of this hook.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `ready` <sup>deprecated</sup>

Use the new `mounted` hook instead. It should be noted though that with `mounted`, there's no guarantee to be in-document. For that, also include `Vue.nextTick`/`vm.$nextTick`. For example:

``` js
mounted: function () {
  this.$nextTick(function () {
    // code that assumes this.$el is in-document
  })
}
```

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find all examples of this hook.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

## `v-for`

### `v-for` Argument Order for Arrays

When including an `index`, the argument order for arrays used to be `(index, value)`. It is now `(value, index)` to be more consistent with JavaScript's native array methods such as `forEach` and `map`.

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find examples of the deprecated argument order. Note that if you name your index arguments something unusual like <code>position</code> or <code>num</code>, the helper will not flag them.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `v-for` Argument Order for Objects

When including a `key`, the argument order for objects used to be `(key, value)`. It is now `(value, key)` to be more consistent with common object iterators such as lodash's.

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find examples of the deprecated argument order. Note that if you name your key arguments something like <code>name</code> or <code>property</code>, the helper will not flag them.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `$index` and `$key` <sup>deprecated</sup>

The implicitly assigned `$index` and `$key` variables have been deprecated in favor of explicitly defining them in `v-for`. This makes the code easier to read for developers less experienced with Vue and also results in much clearer behavior when dealing with nested loops.

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find examples of these deprecated variables. If you miss any, you should also see <strong>console errors</strong> such as: <code>Uncaught ReferenceError: $index is not defined</code></p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `track-by` <sup>deprecated</sup>

`track-by` has been replaced with `key`, which works like any other attribute: without the `v-bind:` or `:` prefix, it is treated as a literal string. In most cases, you'd want to use a dynamic binding which expects a full expression instead of a key. For example, in place of:

``` html
<div v-for="item in items" track-by="id">
```

You would now write:

``` html
<div v-for="item in items" v-bind:key="item.id">
```

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find examples of <code>track-by</code>.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `v-for` Range Values

Previously, `v-for="number in 10"` would have `number` starting at 0 and ending at 9. Now it starts at 1 and ends at 10.

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Search your codebase for the regex <code>/\w+ in \d+/</code>. Wherever it appears in a <code>v-for</code>, check to see if you may be affected.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

## Props

### `coerce` Prop Option <sup>deprecated</sup>

If you want to coerce a prop, setup a local computed value based on it instead. For example, instead of:

``` js
props: {
  username: {
    type: String,
    coerce: function (value) {
      return value
        .toLowerCase()
        .replace(/\s+/, '-')
    }
  }
}
```

You could write:

``` js
props: {
  username: String,
},
computed: {
  normalizedUsername: function () {
    return this.username
      .toLowerCase()
      .replace(/\s+/, '-')
  }
}
```

There are a few advantages:

- You still have access to the original value of the prop.
- You are forced to be more explicit, by giving your coerced value a name that differentiates it from the value passed in the prop.

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find examples of the <code>coerce</code> option.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `twoWay` Prop Option <sup>deprecated</sup>

Props are now always one-way down. To produce side effects in the parent scope, a component needs to explicitly emit an event instead of relying on implicit binding. For more information, see:

- [Custom component events](components.html#Custom-Events)
- [Custom input components](components.html#Form-Input-Components-using-Custom-Events) (using component events)
- [Global state management](state-management.html)

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find examples of the <code>twoWay</code> option.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `v-bind` with `.once` and `.sync` Modifiers <sup>deprecated</sup>

Props are now always one-way down. To produce side effects in the parent scope, a component needs to explicitly emit an event instead of relying on implicit binding. For more information, see:

- [Custom component events](components.html#Custom-Events)
- [Custom input components](components.html#Form-Input-Components-using-Custom-Events) (using component events)
- [Global state management](state-management.html)

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find examples of the <code>.once</code> and <code>.sync</code> modifiers.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### Prop Mutation <sup>deprecated</sup>

Mutating a prop locally is now considered an anti-pattern, e.g. declaring a prop and then setting `this.myProp = 'someOtherValue'` in the component. Due to the new rendering mechanism, whenever the parent component re-renders, the child component's local changes will be overwritten.

Most use cases of mutating a prop can be replaced by one of these options:

- a data property, with the prop used to set its default value
- a computed property

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run your end-to-end test suite or app after upgrading and look for <strong>console warnings</strong> about prop mutations.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### Props on a Root Instance <sup>deprecated</sup>

On root Vue instances (i.e. instances created with `new Vue({ ... })`), you must use `propsData` instead of `props`.

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run your end-to-end test suite, if you have one. The <strong>failed tests</strong> should alert to you to the fact that props passed to root instances are no longer working.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

## Built-In Directives

### Truthiness/Falsiness with `v-bind`

When used with `v-bind`, the only falsy values are now: `null`, `undefined`, and `false`. This means `0` and empty strings will render as truthy. So for example, `v-bind:draggable="''"` will render as `draggable="true"`.

For enumerated attributes, in addition to the falsy values above, the string `"false"` will also render as `attr="false"`.

<p class="tip">Note that for other directives (e.g. `v-if` and `v-show`), JavaScript's normal truthiness still applies.</p>

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run your end-to-end test suite, if you have one. The <strong>failed tests</strong> should alert to you to any parts of your app that may be affected by this change.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### Listening for Native Events on Components with `v-on`

When used on a component, `v-on` now only listens to custom events `$emit`ted by that component. To listen for a native DOM event on the root element, you can use the `.native` modifier. For example:

``` html
<my-component v-on:click.native="doSomething"></my-component>
```

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run your end-to-end test suite, if you have one. The <strong>failed tests</strong> should alert to you to any parts of your app that may be affected by this change.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `v-model` with `debounce` <sup>deprecated</sup>

Debouncing is used to limit how often we execute Ajax requests and other expensive operations. Vue's `debounce` attribute parameter for `v-model` made this easy for very simple cases, but it actually debounced __state updates__ rather than the expensive operations themselves. It's a subtle difference, but it comes with limitations as an application grows.

These limitations become apparent when designing a search indicator, like this one for example:

{% raw %}
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/lodash/4.13.1/lodash.js"></script>
<div id="debounce-search-demo" class="demo">
  <input v-model="searchQuery" placeholder="Type something">
  <strong>{{ searchIndicator }}</strong>
</div>
<script>
new Vue({
  el: '#debounce-search-demo',
  data: {
    searchQuery: '',
    searchQueryIsDirty: false,
    isCalculating: false
  },
  computed: {
    searchIndicator: function () {
      if (this.isCalculating) {
        return 'âŸ³ Fetching new results'
      } else if (this.searchQueryIsDirty) {
        return '... Typing'
      } else {
        return 'âœ“ Done'
      }
    }
  },
  watch: {
    searchQuery: function () {
      this.searchQueryIsDirty = true
      this.expensiveOperation()
    }
  },
  methods: {
    expensiveOperation: _.debounce(function () {
      this.isCalculating = true
      setTimeout(function () {
        this.isCalculating = false
        this.searchQueryIsDirty = false
      }.bind(this), 1000)
    }, 500)
  }
})
</script>
{% endraw %}

Using the `debounce` attribute, there'd be no way to detect the "Typing" state, because we lose access to the input's real-time state. By decoupling the debounce function from Vue however, we're able to debounce only the operation we want to limit, removing the limits on features we can develop:

``` html
<!--
By using the debounce function from lodash or another dedicated
utility library, we know the specific debounce implementation we
use will be best-in-class - and we can use it ANYWHERE. Not just
in our template.
-->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/lodash/4.13.1/lodash.js"></script>
<div id="debounce-search-demo">
  <input v-model="searchQuery" placeholder="Type something">
  <strong>{{ searchIndicator }}</strong>
</div>
```

``` js
new Vue({
  el: '#debounce-search-demo',
  data: {
    searchQuery: '',
    searchQueryIsDirty: false,
    isCalculating: false
  },
  computed: {
    searchIndicator: function () {
      if (this.isCalculating) {
        return 'âŸ³ Fetching new results'
      } else if (this.searchQueryIsDirty) {
        return '... Typing'
      } else {
        return 'âœ“ Done'
      }
    }
  },
  watch: {
    searchQuery: function () {
      this.searchQueryIsDirty = true
      this.expensiveOperation()
    }
  },
  methods: {
    // This is where the debounce actually belongs.
    expensiveOperation: _.debounce(function () {
      this.isCalculating = true
      setTimeout(function () {
        this.isCalculating = false
        this.searchQueryIsDirty = false
      }.bind(this), 1000)
    }, 500)
  }
})
```

Another advantage of this approach is there will be times when debouncing isn't quite the right wrapper function. For example, when hitting an API for search suggestions, waiting to offer suggestions until after the user has stopped typing for a period of time isn't an ideal experience. What you probably want instead is a __throttling__ function. Now since you're already using a utility library like lodash, refactoring to use its `throttle` function instead takes only a few seconds.

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find examples of the <code>debounce</code> attribute.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `v-model` with `lazy` or `number` Param Attributes <sup>deprecated</sup>

The `lazy` and `number` param attributes are now modifiers, to make it more clear what That means instead of:

``` html
<input v-model="name" lazy>
<input v-model="age" type="number" number>
```

You would use:

``` html
<input v-model.lazy="name">
<input v-model.number="age" type="number">
```

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find examples of the these deprecated param attributes.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `v-model` with Inline `value` <sup>deprecated</sup>

`v-model` no longer cares about the initial value of an inline `value` attribute. For predictability, it will instead always treat the Vue instance data as the source of truth.

That means this element:

``` html
<input v-model="text" value="foo">
```

backed by this data:

``` js
data: {
  text: 'bar'
}
```

will render with a value of "bar" instead of "foo". The same goes for a `<textarea>` with existing content. Instead of:

``` html
<textarea v-model="text">
  hello world
</textarea>
```

You should ensure your initial value for `text` is "hello world".

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run your end-to-end test suite or app after upgrading and look for <strong>console warnings</strong> about inline value attributes with <code>v-model</code>.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `v-model` with `v-for` Iterated Primitive Values <sup>deprecated</sup>

Cases like this no longer work:

``` html
<input v-for="str in strings" v-model="str">
```

The reason is this is the equivalent JavaScript that the `<input>` would compile to:

``` js
strings.map(function (str) {
  return createElement('input', ...)
})
```

As you can see, `v-model`'s two-way binding doesn't make sense here. Setting `str` to another value in the iterator function will do nothing because it's just a local variable in the function scope.

Instead, you should use an array of __objects__ so that `v-model` can update the field on the object. For example:

``` html
<input v-for="obj in objects" v-model="obj.str">
```

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run your test suite, if you have one. The <strong>failed tests</strong> should alert to you to any parts of your app that may be affected by this change.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `v-bind:style` with Object Syntax and `!important` <sup>deprecated</sup>

This will no longer work:

``` html
<p v-bind:style="{ color: myColor + ' !important' }">hello</p>
```

If you really need to override another `!important`, you must use the string syntax:

``` html
<p v-bind:style="'color: ' + myColor + ' !important'">hello</p>
```

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find examples of style bindings with <code>!important</code> in objects.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `v-el` and `v-ref` <sup>deprecated</sup>

For simplicity, `v-el` and `v-ref` have been merged into the `ref` attribute, accessible on a component instance via `$refs`. That means `v-el:my-element` would become `ref="myElement"` and `v-ref:my-component` would become `ref="myComponent"`. When used on a normal element, the `ref` will be the DOM element, and when used on a component, the `ref` will be the component instance.

Since `v-ref` is no longer a directive, but a special attribute, it can also be dynamically defined. This is especially useful in combination with `v-for`. For example:

``` html
<p v-for="item in items" v-bind:ref="'item' + item.id"></p>
```

Previously, `v-el`/`v-ref` combined with `v-for` would produce an array of elements/components, because there was no way to give each item a unique name. You can still achieve this behavior by given each item the same `ref`:

``` html
<p v-for="item in items" ref="items"></p>
```

Unlike in 1.x, these `$refs` are not reactive, because they're registered/updated during the render process itself. Making them reactive would require duplicate renders for every change.

On the other hand, `$refs` are designed primarily for programmatic access in JavaScript - it is not recommended to rely on them in templates, because that would mean referring to state that does not belong to the instance itself. This would violate Vue's data-driven view model.

</div>
{% endraw %}

### `v-else` with `v-show` <sup>deprecated</sup>

`v-else` no longer works with `v-show`. Use `v-if` with a negation expression instead. For example, instead of:

``` html
<p v-if="foo">Foo</p>
<p v-else v-show="bar">Not foo, but bar</p>
```

You can use:

``` html
<p v-if="foo">Foo</p>
<p v-if="!foo && bar">Not foo, but bar</p>
```

</div>
{% endraw %}

## Custom Directives

Directives have a greatly reduced scope of responsibility: they are now only used for applying low-level direct DOM manipulations. In most cases, you should prefer using components as the main code-reuse abstraction.

Some of the most notable differences include:

- Directives no longer have instances. This means there's no more `this` inside directive hooks. Instead, they receive everything they might need as arguments. If you really must persist state across hooks, you can do so on `el`.
- Options such as `acceptStatement`, `deep`, `priority`, etc are all deprecated. To replace `twoWay` directives, see [this example](#Two-Way-Filters-deprecated).
- Some of the current hooks have different behavior and there are also a couple new hooks.

Fortunately, since the new directives are much simpler, you can master them more easily. Read the new [Custom Directives guide](custom-directive.html) to learn more.

</div>
{% endraw %}

### Directive `.literal` Modifier <sup>deprecated</sup>

The `.literal` modifier has been removed, as the same can be easily achieved by just providing a string literal as the value.

For example, you can update:

``` js
<p v-my-directive.literal="foo bar baz"></p>
```

to just:

``` html
<p v-my-directive="'foo bar baz'"></p>
```

{% endraw %}

## Transitions

### `transition` Attribute <sup>deprecated</sup>

Vue's transition system has changed quite drastically and now uses `<transition>` and `<transition-group>` wrapper elements, rather than the `transition` attribute. It's recommended to read the new [Transitions guide](transitions.html) to learn more.

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find examples of the <code>transition</code> attribute.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `Vue.transition` for Reusable Transitions <sup>deprecated</sup>

With the new transition system, you can now just [use components for reusable transitions](http://rc.vuejs.org/guide/transitions.html#Reusable-Transitions).

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find examples of <code>Vue.transition</code>.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### Transition `stagger` Attribute <sup>deprecated</sup>

If you need to stagger list transitions, you can control timing by setting and accessing a `data-index` (or similar attribute) on an element. See [an example here](transitions.html#Staggering-List-Transitions).

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find examples of the <code>transition</code> attribute. During your update, you can transition (pun very much intended) to the new staggering strategy as well.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

## Events

### `events` option <sup>deprecated</sup>

The `events` option has been deprecated. Event handlers should now be registered in the `created` hook instead. Check out the [`$dispatch` and `$broadcast` migration guide](#dispatch-and-broadcast-deprecated) for a detailed example.

### `Vue.directive('on').keyCodes` <sup>deprecated</sup>

The new, more concise way to configure `keyCodes` is through`Vue.config.keyCodes`. For example:

``` js
// enable v-on:keyup.f1
Vue.config.keyCodes.f1 = 112
```

</div>
{% endraw %}

### `$dispatch` and `$broadcast` <sup>deprecated</sup>

`$dispatch` and `$broadcast` are being deprecated in favor of more explicitly cross-component communication and more maintainable state management solutions, such as [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex).

The problem is event flows that depend on a component's tree structure can be hard to reason about and very brittle when the tree becomes large. It simply doesn't scale well and we don't want to set you up for pain later. `$dispatch` and `$broadcast` also do not solve communication between sibling components.

One of the most common uses for these methods is to communicate between a parent and its direct children. In these cases, you can actually [listen to an `$emit` from a child with `v-on`](http://vuejs.org/guide/components.html#Form-Input-Components-using-Custom-Events). This allows you to keep the convenience of events with added explicitness.

However, when communicating between distant descendants/ancestors, `$emit` won't help you. Instead, the simplest possible upgrade would be to use a centralized event hub. This has the added benefit of allowing you to communicate between components no matter where they are in the component tree - even between siblings! Because Vue instances implement an event emitter interface, you can actually use an empty Vue instance for this purpose.

For example, let's say we have a todo app structured like this:

```
Todos
|-- NewTodoInput
|-- Todo
    |-- DeleteTodoButton
```

We could manage communication between components with this single event hub:

``` js
// This is the event hub we'll use in every
// component to communicate between them.
var eventHub = new Vue()
```

Then in our components, we can use `$emit`, `$on`, `$off` to emit events, listen for events, and clean up event listeners, respectively:

``` js
// NewTodoInput
// ...
methods: {
  addTodo: function () {
    eventHub.$emit('add-todo', { text: this.newTodoText })
    this.newTodoText = ''
  }
}
```

``` js
// DeleteTodoButton
// ...
methods: {
  deleteTodo: function (id) {
    eventHub.$emit('delete-todo', id)
  }
}
```

``` js
// Todos
// ...
created: function () {
  eventHub.$on('add-todo', this.addTodo)
  eventHub.$on('delete-todo', this.deleteTodo)
},
// It's good to clean up event listeners before
// a component is destroyed.
beforeDestroy: function () {
  eventHub.$off('add-todo', this.addTodo)
  eventHub.$off('delete-todo', this.deleteTodo)
},
methods: {
  addTodo: function (newTodo) {
    this.todos.push(newTodo)
  },
  deleteTodo: function (todoId) {
    this.todos = this.todos.filter(function (todo) {
      return todo.id !== todoId
    })
  }
}
```

This pattern can serve as a replacement for `$dispatch` and `$broadcast` in simple scenarios, but for more complex cases, it's recommended to use a dedicated state management layer such as [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex).

## Filters

### Filters Outside Text Interpolations <sup>deprecated</sup>

Filters can now only be used inside text interpolations (`{% raw %}{{ }}{% endraw %}` tags). In the past we've found using filters within directives such as `v-model`, `v-on`, etc led to more complexity than convenience. For list filtering on `v-for`, it's also better to move that logic into JavaScript as computed properties, so that it can be reused throughout your component.

In general, whenever something can be achieved in plain JavaScript, we want to avoid introducing a special syntax like filters to take care of the same concern. Here's how you can replace Vue's built-in directive filters:

#### Replacing the `debounce` Filter

Instead of:

``` html
<input v-on:keyup="doStuff | debounce 500">
```

``` js
methods: {
  doStuff: function () {
    // ...
  }
}
```

Use [lodash's `debounce`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.15.0#debounce) (or possibly [`throttle`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.15.0#throttle)) to directly limit calling the expensive method. You can achieve the same as above like this:

``` html
<input v-on:keyup="doStuff">
```

``` js
methods: {
  doStuff: _.debounce(function () {
    // ...
  }, 500)
}
```

For more on the advantages of this strategy, see [the example here with `v-model`](#v-model-with-debounce-deprecated).

#### Replacing the `limitBy` Filter

Instead of:

``` html
<p v-for="item in items | limitBy 10">{{ item }}</p>
```

Use JavaScript's built-in [`.slice` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice#Examples) in a computed property:

``` html
<p v-for="item in filteredItems">{{ item }}</p>
```

``` js
computed: {
  filteredItems: function () {
    return this.items.slice(0, 10)
  }
}
```

#### Replacing the `filterBy` Filter

Instead of:

``` html
<p v-for="user in users | filterBy searchQuery in 'name'">{{ user.name }}</p>
```

Use JavaScript's built-in [`.filter` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter#Examples) in a computed property:

``` html
<p v-for="user in filteredUsers">{{ user.name }}</p>
```

``` js
computed: {
  filteredUsers: function () {
    return this.users.filter(function (user) {
      return user.name.indexOf(this.searchQuery) !== -1
    })
  }
}
```

JavaScript's native `.filter` can also manage much more complex filtering operations, because you have access to the full power of JavaScript within computed properties. For example, if you wanted to find all active users and case-insensitively match against both their name and email:

``` js
this.users.filter(function (user) {
  var searchRegex = new RegExp(this.searchQuery, 'i')
  return user.isActive && (
    searchRegex.test(user.name) ||
    searchRegex.test(user.email)
  )
})
```

#### Replacing the `orderBy` Filter

Instead of:

``` html
<p v-for="user in users | orderBy 'name'">{{ user.name }}</p>
```

Use [lodash's `orderBy`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.15.0#orderBy) (or possibly [`sortBy`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.15.0#sortBy)) in a computed property:

``` html
<p v-for="user in orderedUsers">{{ user.name }}</p>
```

``` js
computed: {
  orderedUsers: function () {
    return _.orderBy(this.users, 'name')
  }
}
```

You can even order by multiple columns:

``` js
_.orderBy(this.users, ['name', 'last_login'], ['asc', 'desc'])
```

</div>
{% endraw %}

### Filter Argument Syntax

Filters' syntax for arguments now better aligns with JavaScript function invocation. So instead of taking space-delimited arguments:

``` html
<p>{{ date | formatDate 'YY-MM-DD' timeZone }}</p>
```

We surround the arguments with parentheses and delimit the arguments with commas:

``` html
<p>{{ date | formatDate('YY-MM-DD', timeZone) }}</p>
```

</div>
{% endraw %}

### Built-In Text Filters <sup>deprecated</sup>

Although filters within text interpolations are still allowed, all of the filters have been removed. Instead, it's recommended to use more specialized libraries for solving problems in each domain (e.g. [`date-fns`](https://date-fns.org/) to format dates and [`accounting`](http://openexchangerates.github.io/accounting.js/) for currencies).

For each of Vue's built-in text filters, we go through how you can replace them below. The example code could exist in custom helper functions, methods, or computed properties.

#### Replacing the `json` Filter

You actually don't need to for debugging anymore, as Vue will nicely format output for you automatically, whether it's a string, number, array, or plain object. If you want the exact same functionality as JavaScript's `JSON.stringify` though, then you can use that in a method or computed property.

#### Replacing the `capitalize` Filter

``` js
text[0].toUpperCase() + text.slice(1)
```

#### Replacing the `uppercase` Filter

``` js
text.toUpperCase()
```

#### Replacing the `lowercase` Filter

``` js
text.toLowerCase()
```

#### Replacing the `pluralize` Filter

The [pluralize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pluralize) package on NPM serves this purpose nicely, but if you only want to pluralize a specific word or want to have special output for cases like `0`, then you can also easily define your own pluralize functions. For example:

``` js
function pluralizeKnife (count) {
  if (count === 0) {
    return 'no knives'
  } else if (count === 1) {
    return '1 knife'
  } else {
    return count + 'knives'
  }
}
```

#### Replacing the `currency` Filter

For a very naive implementation, you could just do something like this:

``` js
'$' + price.toFixed(2)
```

In many cases though, you'll still run into strange behavior (e.g. `0.035.toFixed(2)` rounds up to `0.4`, but `0.045` rounds down to `0.4`). To work around these issues, you can use the [`accounting`](http://openexchangerates.github.io/accounting.js/) library to more reliably format currencies.

</div>
{% endraw %}

### Two-Way Filters <sup>deprecated</sup>

Some users have enjoyed using two-way filters with `v-model` to create interesting inputs with very little code. While _seemingly_ simple however, two-way filters can also hide a great deal of complexity - and even encourage poor UX by delaying state updates. Instead, components wrapping an input are recommended as a more explicit and feature-rich way of creating custom inputs.

As an example, we'll now walk the migration of a two-way currency filter:

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://jsfiddle.net/chrisvfritz/6744xnjk/embedded/js,html,result" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

It mostly works well, but the delayed state updates can cause strange behavior. For example, click on the `Result` tab and try entering `9.999` into one of those inputs. When the input loses focus, its value will update to `$10.00`. When looking at the calculated total however, you'll see that `9.999` is what's stored in our data. The version of reality that the user sees is out of sync!

To start transitioning towards a more robust solution using Vue 2.0, let's first wrap this filter in a new `<currency-input>` component:

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://jsfiddle.net/chrisvfritz/943zfbsh/embedded/js,html,result" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

This allows us add behavior that a filter alone couldn't encapsulate, such as selecting the content of an input on focus. Now the next step will be to extract the business logic from the filter. Below, we pull everything out into an external [`currencyValidator` object](https://gist.github.com/chrisvfritz/5f0a639590d6e648933416f90ba7ae4e):

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://jsfiddle.net/chrisvfritz/9c32kev2/embedded/js,html,result" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

This increased modularity not only makes it easier to migrate to Vue 2, but also allows currency parsing and formatting to be:

- unit tested in isolation from your Vue code
- used by other parts of your application, such as to validate the payload to an API endpoint

Having this validator extracted out, we've also more comfortably built it up into a more robust solution. The state quirks have been eliminated and it's actually impossible for users to enter anything wrong, similar to what the browser's native number input tries to do.

We're still limited however, by filters and by Vue 1.0 in general, so let's complete the upgrade to Vue 2.0:

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://jsfiddle.net/chrisvfritz/1oqjojjx/embedded/js,html,result" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

You may notice that:

- Every aspect of our input is more explicit, using lifecycle hooks and DOM events in place of the hidden behavior of two-way filters.
- We can now use `v-model` directly on our custom inputs, which is not only more consistent with normal inputs, but also means our component is Vuex-friendly.
- Since we're no longer using filter options that require a value to be returned, our currency work could actually be done asynchronously. That means if we had a lot of apps that had to work with currencies, we could easily refactor this logic into a shared microservice.

## Slots

### Duplicate Slots <sup>deprecated</sup>

It is no longer supported to have `<slot>`s with the same name in the same template. When a slot is rendered it is "used up" and cannot be rendered elsewhere in the same render tree. If you must render the same content in multiple places, pass that content as a prop.

### `slot` Attribute Styling <sup>deprecated</sup>

Content inserted via named `<slot>` no longer preserves the `slot` attribute. Use a wrapper element to style them, or for advanced use cases, modify the inserted content programmatically using [render functions](render-function.html).

</div>
{% endraw %}

## Special Attributes

### `keep-alive` Attribute <sup>deprecated</sup>

`keep-alive` is no longer a special attribute, but rather a wrapper component, similar to `<transition>`. For example:

``` html
<keep-alive>
  <component v-bind:is="view"></component>
</keep-alive>
```

This makes it possible to use `<keep-alive>` on multiple conditional children:

``` html
<keep-alive>
  <todo-list v-if="todos.length > 0"></todo-list>
  <no-todos-gif v-else></no-todos-gif>
</keep-alive>
```

<p class="tip">When `<keep-alive>` has multiple children, they should eventually evaluate to a single child. Any child other than the first one will simply be ignored.</p>

When used together with `<transition>`, make sure to nest it inside:

``` html
<transition>
  <keep-alive>
    <component v-bind:is="view"></component>
  </keep-alive>
</transition>
```

## Interpolation

### Interpolation within Attributes <sup>deprecated</sup>

Interpolation within attributes is no longer valid. For example:

``` html
<button class="btn btn-{{ size }}"></button>
```

Should either be updated to use an inline expression:

``` html
<button v-bind:class="'btn btn-' + size"></button>
```

Or a data/computed property:

``` html
<button v-bind:class="buttonClasses"></button>
```

``` js
computed: {
  buttonClasses: function () {
    return 'btn btn-' + size
  }
}
```

## Reactivity

### `vm.$watch`

Watchers created via `vm.$watch` are now fired before the associated component rerenders. This gives you the chance to further update state before the component rerender, thus avoiding unnecessary updates. For example, you can watch a component prop and update the component's own data when the prop changes.

If you were previously relying on `vm.$watch` to do something with the DOM after a component updates, you can instead do so in the `updated` lifecycle hook.

{% raw %}

})

<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find examples of <code>Vue.config.async</code>.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `Vue.config.delimiters` <sup>deprecated</sup>

This has been reworked as a [component-level option](/api/#delimiters). This allows you to use alternative delimiters within your app without breaking 3rd-party components.

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find examples of <code>Vue.config.delimiters</code>.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `Vue.config.unsafeDelimiters` <sup>deprecated</sup>

HTML interpolation has been [deprecated in favor of `v-html`](#HTML-Interpolation-deprecated).

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find examples of <code>Vue.config.unsafeDelimiters</code>. After this, the helper will also find instances of HTML interpolation so that you can replace them with `v-html`.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

## Global API

### `Vue.extend` with `el` <sup>deprecated</sup>

The el option can no longer be used in `Vue.extend`. It's only valid as an instance creation option.

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run your end-to-end test suite or app after upgrading and look for <strong>console warnings</strong> about the <code>el</code> option with <code>Vue.extend</code>.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `Vue.elementDirective` <sup>deprecated</sup>

Use components instead.

{% raw %}
<div class="upgrade-path">
  <h4>Upgrade Path</h4>
  <p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-migration-helper">migration helper</a> on your codebase to find examples of <code>Vue.elementDirective</code>.</p>
</div>
{% endraw %}

### `Vue.partial` <sup>deprecated</sup>

Partials have been deprecated in favor of more explicit data flow between components, using props. Unless you're using a partial in a performance-critical area, the recommendation is to simply use a [normal component](components.html) instead. If you were dynamically binding the `name` of a partial, you can use a [dynamic component](http://vuejs.org/guide/components.html#Dynamic-Components).

If you happen to be using partials in a performance-critical part of your app, then you should upgrade to [functional components](render-function.html#Functional-Components). They must be in a plain JS/JSX file (rather than in a `.vue` file) and are stateless and instanceless, just like partials. This makes rendering extremely fast.

A benefit of functional components over partials is that they can be much more dynamic, because they grant you access to the full power of JavaScript. There is a cost to this power however. If you've never used a component framework with render functions before, they may take a bit longer to learn.
