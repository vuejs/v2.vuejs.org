## Running

`script/build`. You may need to tweak the `project.clj` so that the
ClojureScript version matches what gets install into your `.m2`
directory. Install Om by cloning and running `lein install`. Then
clone this repo and run `lein cljsbuild once release`. Open
`index.html` in your favorite browser.
