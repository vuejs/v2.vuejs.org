### capitalize

*'abc' => 'Abc'*

### uppercase

*'abc' => 'ABC'*

### lowercase

*'ABC' => 'abc'*

### currency

- this filter takes one optional argument

*12345 => $12,345.00*

You can pass an optional argument which will be used as the currency symbol (default is $).

### pluralize

- this filter takes at least one argument

Pluralizes the argument based on the filtered value. When there is exactly one arg, plural forms simply add an "s" at the end. When there are more than one argument, the arguments will be used as array of strings corresponding to the single, double, triple ... forms of the word to be pluralized. When the number to be pluralized exceeds the length of the args, it will use the last entry in the array.

**Example:**

``` html
{{count}} {{count | pluralize 'item'}}
```

*1 => '1 item'*  
*2 => '2 items'*

``` html
{{date}}{{date | pluralize 'st' 'nd' 'rd' 'th'}}
```

Will result in:

*1 => '1st'*  
*2 => '2nd'*
*3 => '3rd'*
*4 => '4th'*
*5 => '5th'*

### json

- this filter takes one optional argument

JSON.stringify() incoming value rather than outputting the string representation (i.e. `[object Object]`). It also takes one optional argument which is the indent level (defaults to 2):

``` html
<pre>{{$data | json 4}}</pre>
```

### key

- this filter only works with `v-on`
- this filter takes exactly one argument

Wrap the handler so it only gets called when the keyCode matches the argument. You can also use string aliases for a few commonly-used keys:

- enter
- tab
- delete
- esc
- up
- down
- left
- right

**Example:**

``` html
<input v-on="keyup:doSomething | key 'enter'">
```

`doSomething` will only be called when the Enter key is pressed.

### debounce

- this filter only works with `v-on`
- this filter takes one optional argument

Wrap the handler to debounce it for X milliseconds, where X is the argument. Default is 300ms. A debounced handler will be delayed until at least X ms has passed after the call moment; if the handler is called again before the delay period, the delay poriod is reset to X ms.

### filterBy

**Syntax:** `filterBy searchKey [in dataKey...]`.

- this filter only works for Array values

Return a filtered version of the source Array. The `searchKey` argument is a property key on the context ViewModel. The value of that property will be used as the string to search for:

``` html
<input v-model="searchText">
<ul>
  <li v-repeat="users | filterBy searchText">{{name}}</li>
</ul>
```

When the filter is applied, it will filter the `users` Array by recursively searching for the current value of `searchText` on each item in the Array. For example, if an item is `{ name: 'Jack', phone: '555-123-4567' }` and `searchText` has value `'555'`, the item will be considered a match.

Optionally, you can narrow down which specific property to search in with the optional `in dataKey` argument:

``` html
<input v-model="searchText">
<ul>
  <li v-repeat="user in users | filterBy searchText in 'name'">{{name}}</li>
</ul>
```

Now the item will only match if the value of `searchText` is found in its `name` property. Note here we need to quote `name` to indicate it's a literal string argument. With this limitation, `searchText` with value `'555'` will no longer match this item, but `'Jack'` will.

> New in 0.12.11

Starting in 0.12.11 you can pass in multiple data keys:

``` html
<li v-repeat="user in uers | filterBy searchText in 'name' 'phone'"></li>
```

Or pass in a dynamic argument with an Array value:

``` html
<!-- fields = ['fieldA', 'fieldB'] -->
<div v-repeat="user in users | filterBy searchText in fields">
```

Or, just pass in a custom filter function:

``` html
<div v-repeat="user in users | filterBy myCustomFilterFunction">
```
Where [myCustomFilterFunction] is regular [vm] method accepting three arguments [user], [index] and [users] from the example above.

### orderBy

**Syntax:** `orderBy sortKey [reverseKey]`.

- this filter only works for Array values

Return a sorted version of the source Array. The `sortKey` argument is a property key on the context ViewModel. The value of that property will be used as the key to sort the Array items with. The optional `reverseKey` argument is also a property key on the context ViewModel, but the value's truthiness will determine whether the result should be reversed.

``` html
<ul>
  <li v-repeat="user in users | orderBy field reverse">{{name}}</li>
</ul>
```

``` js
new Vue({
  /* ... */
  data: {
    field: 'name',
    reverse: false
  }
})
```

You can also use quotes for literal sort key. To indicate a literal reverse, use `-1`:

``` html
<ul>
  <li v-repeat="user in users | orderBy 'name' -1">{{name}}</li>
</ul>
```
